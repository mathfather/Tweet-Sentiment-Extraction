# Tweet-Sentiment-Extraction
In this project we use both recurrent neural model and Transformer-based neural models to attempt the Tweet-Sentiment-Extraction task from https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction/overview/description.
## Dataset Overview
* The dataset can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction/overview/description.
* We're trying to predict the `selected field' of each example, where the excerpt from the original tweet should best support the sentiment characterization.

## Requirements

## Models
### LSTM baseline


### BiLSTM with auxiliary sentiment input


### BiLSTM with embedded parallel input

### BERT without sentiment
 
 
### BERT model with sentiment
